# Binary tree in Rust
I forbid you to use it. This is unusable, unreadable, wrong-implemented bullshit.
I warned you.

# Implemented
- Adding to tree
- Removing from tree
- Cool looking (for small trees) Display trait
- Find value
- Some support functions:
  - Max value
  - is_empty
  - Depth of the tree

# Funny performance
Adding 1.000.000 random integers in range from 0 to 10.000 requires:
real	 0m0.970s
user   0m0.871s
sys    0m0.109s
